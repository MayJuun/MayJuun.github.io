The app allows EMTs to access the guidelines and protocols necessary for on-shift patient care.
This app builds heavily on the use of interactive PDFs. For example, a separate PDF exists for each year the protocol was updated / released. For future projects, additional PDFs may be created to satisfy different needs, such as locations, agencies, clinical settings, etc.</description></item><item><title>WVEMS Protocols</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/portfolio/3-wvems-protocols/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 22:54:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/portfolio/3-wvems-protocols/</guid><description>WVEMS Protocols - The WVEMS Protocols app is a cross-platform Flutter app designed to quickly view, interact, and search through PDFs.

The Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients&amp;rsquo; Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) survey was recreated in a Flutter environment using its [LOINC FHIR速 specification]. The app directly loads the FHIR速 spec (albeit with some basic modifications to the original FHIR速 JSON to more closely match the initial survey). It has basic validation in place for survey completion.
