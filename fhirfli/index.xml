However, where I thought I might be able value is with some additional examples.
All of these examples are from a project I&amp;rsquo;m currently involved with for New Jersey Integrated Care for Kids. The idea behind this project is that a clinician (social worker, teacher, etc.</description></item><item><title>My First FHIR/Flutter App</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/1-first-fhir-flutter-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 23:55:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/1-first-fhir-flutter-app/</guid><description>How To Start Link to full Github Code
For this, I am going to assume that you already know how to install flutter, dart and VS Code (or android studio) on your computer. If not, there are many good tutorials - many found on this very website. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have it, go get it, then you can come back here.
Following these instructions here, I first created the basic flutter application.</description></item><item><title>Azure FHIR® Setup</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/6-azure_fhir_setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 23:55:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/6-azure_fhir_setup/</guid><description>Azure FHIR® Setup Some of you may need to use the Azure FHIR® server (my apologies in advance, it cost me $80 over two weeks and then I was like, screw this). However, before I canceled it, I did manage to get authentication to work. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure all of the settings I&amp;rsquo;ve used are required, but this is what I needed to get it to work properly (why is authentication such a pain in the ass?</description></item><item><title>Questionnaires and Surveys</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/5-questionnaires-and-surveys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 23:55:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/5-questionnaires-and-surveys/</guid><description>FHIR® Questionnaire As usual, the FHIR® documentation, while complete, is difficult to get through in order to understand how to structure surveys. John has created a really nice demo app to render the Prapare® Survey specifically (https://github.com/FireJuun/prapare). There is also now a very nice dynamic renderer package called Faiadashu, thanks Tilo!
I&amp;rsquo;m also working on creating surveys from a REDCap library, and also from a spreadsheet, but those are works in progress.</description></item><item><title>Flutter Servers</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/4-flutter-servers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 23:54:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/4-flutter-servers/</guid><description>This is a reproduction of the readme from the repo here. Have you ever wanted to try and host your Flutter web app but weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how to do it? I like Dart and Flutter, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to learn another language just to have a web server. Luckily, there are a couple of packages that already have this functionality. I&amp;rsquo;ve just detailed how they work, and how they can be placed in a docker container for easy deployment (including on Google Cloud!</description></item><item><title>GCP Healthcare API Part 1: Creating FHIR® Store</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/2-gcp-fhir-flutter-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:24:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/2-gcp-fhir-flutter-1/</guid><description>Creating FHIR Store I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on athentication and authorization for FHIR® (including SMART, although not solely). And like so many things, it seems harder than it should be. Google has been giving me problems, so as I work through it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document my steps, in the hope it will help me (and maybe someone else) in the future.
The first step is that you have to sign up for Google Cloud Platform (oh yeah, while I really like Google&amp;rsquo;s tools, they&amp;rsquo;re not paying me anything).</description></item><item><title>GCP Healthcare API Part 2: Attempting Authentication</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/3-gcp-fhir-flutter-2-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:24:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/3-gcp-fhir-flutter-2-/</guid><description>GCP Healthcare API - Attempting Authentication Again, I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to be tricky, hence why I&amp;rsquo;m documenting here, to hopefully make it easier for someone else. Remember, we should now have a FHIR® store. The one I&amp;rsquo;ve setup exists at:
https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/fhir-fli/locations/us/datasets/fhir-fli/fhirStores/fhir-fli
So I&amp;rsquo;ve probably thrown these words around and not completely understanding the difference, so, for your edification:
Authentication: who you are Authorization: what you can do Auditing logs: what you did This comes from Google&amp;rsquo;s page on Authentication.</description></item></channel></rss>
