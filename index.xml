      <description>How To Start Link to full Github Code
For this, I am going to assume that you already know how to install flutter, dart and VS Code (or android studio) on your computer. If not, there are many good tutorials - many found on this very website. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have it, go get it, then you can come back here.
Following these instructions here, I first created the basic flutter application.</description>

      <title>Get Fluttered: MVC&#43;S Architecture, Example</title>

      <description>Intro - To all who watched my original GetFluttered: MVC+S Architecture video, I want to thank you immensely for your patience.
Before making new GetFluttered videos, we wanted to implement:
 A means to provide written, supplemental info &amp;hellip; Meta-Blog; A complex, production-level MVC+S example &amp;hellip; PRAPARE app; &amp;amp; A means for others to join / collaborate &amp;hellip; FlutterJuun Slack invite.  With these elements now firmly established, it should be easier to follow along with GetFluttered content by comparing simple + complex code examples that achieve the same objective.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Post for a Meta-Blog</title>

      <description>Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog - Knowledge is power&amp;hellip;and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others&#39; knowledge.
Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that&amp;rsquo;s only my preference. If there&amp;rsquo;s something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Try to add/share some knowledge if you can&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t just post something that&amp;rsquo;s a shameless plug for your work.</description>

      <description>PRAPARE SURVEY This is a work in progress. The Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients&#39; Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) survey was recreated in a Flutter environment using its LOINC FHIR specification. The app directly loads the FHIR spec (albeit with some basic modifications to the original FHIR JSON to more closely match the initial survey). It has basic validation in place for survey completion.
