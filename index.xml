      <description>Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog Knowledge is power&amp;hellip;and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others&#39; knowledge.
Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that&amp;rsquo;s only my preference. If there&amp;rsquo;s something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Just don&amp;rsquo;t use this as a shameless plug for your work.</description>

      <description>PRAPARE SURVEY This is a work in progress. The Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients&#39; Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) survey was recreated in a Flutter environment using its LOINC FHIR specification. The app directly loads the FHIR spec (albeit with some basic modifications to the original FHIR JSON to more closely match the initial survey). It has basic validation in place for survey completion.
