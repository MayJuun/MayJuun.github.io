It is being used clinically in 7 cities and 12 counties in southwest Virginia. The app allows EMTs to access the guidelines and protocols necessary for on-shift patient care.
This app builds heavily on the use of interactive PDFs. For example, a separate PDF exists for each year the protocol was updated / released.</description></item><item><title>PRAPARE Survey</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/portfolio/2-prapare-survey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 05:07:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/portfolio/2-prapare-survey/</guid><description>PRAPARE SURVEY - This is an open-source work in progress. The Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) survey was recreated in a Flutter environment using its [LOINC FHIR速 specification]. The app directly loads the FHIR速 spec (albeit with some basic modifications to the original FHIR速 JSON to more closely match the initial survey). It has basic validation in place for survey completion.
