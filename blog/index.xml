      <description>How To Start Link to full Github Code
For this, I am going to assume that you already know how to install flutter, dart and VS Code (or android studio) on your computer. If not, there are many good tutorials - many found on this very website. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have it, go get it, then you can come back here.
Following these instructions here, I first created the basic flutter application.</description>

      <description>Intro - To all who watched my original GetFluttered: MVC+S Architecture video, I want to thank you immensely for your patience.
Before making new GetFluttered videos, we wanted to implement:
 A means to provide written, supplemental info &amp;hellip; Meta-Blog; A complex, production-level MVC+S example &amp;hellip; PRAPARE app; &amp;amp; A means for others to join / collaborate &amp;hellip; FlutterJuun Slack invite.  With these elements now firmly established, it should be easier to follow along with GetFluttered content by comparing simple + complex code examples that achieve the same objective.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog - Knowledge is power&amp;hellip;and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others&#39; knowledge.
Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that&amp;rsquo;s only my preference. If there&amp;rsquo;s something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Try to add/share some knowledge if you can&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t just post something that&amp;rsquo;s a shameless plug for your work.</description>
