Building apps like these are well within our wheelhouse at MayJuun, and this step seemed like a nice upgrade from the basic business card.
Credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, this app builds heavily upon the open-source (MIT License) QR Code generator library called Project Nayuki. I&amp;rsquo;ve used their code-generator in a number of projects and recommend them highly.</description></item><item><title>WVEMS Protocols - Interactive, Searchable PDFs</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/7-wvems-protocols/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 20:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/7-wvems-protocols/</guid><description>Intro - Today (Oct 5, 2021), we at MayJuun are proud to officially release the WVEMS Protocols Flutter app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.
This was a wonderful project built in collaboration with the Western Virginia Emergency Medical Services Council, Inc, who provides Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Virginia&amp;hellip;specificially in the following 7 cities:
Covington Danville Martinsville Radford Roanoke Salem and 12 counties:</description></item><item><title>Fish and Flutter: 5 Step Install</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/6-fish-and-flutter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 14:04:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/6-fish-and-flutter/</guid><description>Intro - This is a supplemental post to the YouTube video tutorial that shows how to install iTerm, Fish, and Flutter on a Mac.
The video boils everything down to 5 steps, which I will define here.
Step 1: Homebrew + Fish + iTerm2 To get started, you need to follow the Automatic Installation steps on my iterm-fish-fisher repo, or you can just copy/paste the same steps that are listed below.</description></item><item><title>Podcasting in an Open-Source Era</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/5-podcasting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 15:42:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/5-podcasting/</guid><description>Intro - Well, I can&amp;rsquo;t say this is something I&amp;rsquo;ll do with frequency, so I might as well write about this path on the meta-blog. We created an informatics podcast recently, available here. From the time we recorded the original podcast to the time we had all steps/automation established, we unfortunately found ourselves in a position of needing to rebrand.
Looking back, this proved most beneficial, as it forced me to reflect on the steps I previously took to create a podcast that harnesses GitHub and Hugo for its RSS feeds.</description></item><item><title>pdf2json: A Step-by-Step Guide</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/4-pdf-2-json/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 02:44:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/4-pdf-2-json/</guid><description>Intro - Well, I can&amp;rsquo;t say this issue will come up too often for others&amp;hellip;but should you ever need it, here are the exact steps you can take to convert all the text from a PDF file into a JSON file with key-value pairs of &amp;quot;page#&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;all page text without extra white space&amp;quot;. Note that page# is an integer that starts at 1, not 0.
I needed this in a project where the Flutter packages that performed PDF search functions were not performant, had memory leaks, or seemed to work inconsistently across platforms.</description></item><item><title>Bucket List Accomplished! My First Meta-Blog Post</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/3-bucket-list/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 23:55:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/3-bucket-list/</guid><description>Intro - My First Meta-Blog Post!
This has been a challenge to get to this point, and hopefully I haven&amp;rsquo;t corrupted the entire website, but here is my first post. This is really more of a test of my ability in GIT to make the changes from my fork and create a pull request to upate the changes. Sounds easy, right? Not so much&amp;hellip;after watching the intro video, I knew I was in for a challenge because I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand alot of the terminology or have a &amp;lsquo;favorite code editor&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Get Fluttered: MVC+S Architecture, Example</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/2-get-fluttered-mvcs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 19:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/2-get-fluttered-mvcs/</guid><description>Intro - To all who watched my original GetFluttered: MVC+S Architecture video, I want to thank you immensely for your patience.
Before making new GetFluttered videos, we wanted to implement:
A means to provide written, supplemental info &amp;hellip; Meta-Blog; A complex, production-level MVC+S example &amp;hellip; PRAPARE app; &amp;amp; A means for others to join / collaborate &amp;hellip; FlutterJuun Slack invite. With these elements now firmly established, it should be easier to follow along with GetFluttered content by comparing simple + complex code examples that achieve the same objective.</description></item><item><title>A Meta-Post for a Meta-Blog</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/1-meta-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 13:15:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/1-meta-post/</guid><description>Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog - Knowledge is power&amp;hellip;and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others&amp;rsquo; knowledge.
Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that&amp;rsquo;s only my preference. If there&amp;rsquo;s something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Try to add/share some knowledge if you can&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t just post something that&amp;rsquo;s a shameless plug for your work.</description></item></channel></rss>
