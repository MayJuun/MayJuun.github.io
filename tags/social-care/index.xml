MayJuun is partnering with Open City Labs to demonstrate the entire closed-loop referral process, from person identification and screening assessment to creating and managing referrals.
We have also partnered with the Interoperability Institute to connect our questionnaire assessments application (Cuestionario) to their MELD open-source sandbox.
Join Our Mailing List Thanks for meeting with us at HIMSS. We would love to connect.</description></item></channel></rss>
