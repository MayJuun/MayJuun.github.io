And like so many things, it seems harder than it should be. Google has been giving me problems, so as I work through it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document my steps, in the hope it will help me (and maybe someone else) in the future.

https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/fhir-fli/locations/us/datasets/fhir-fli/fhirStores/fhir-fli
So I&amp;rsquo;ve probably thrown these words around and not completely understanding the difference, so, for your edification:
Authentication: who you are Authorization: what you can do Auditing logs: what you did This comes from Google&amp;rsquo;s page on Authentication.</description></item></channel></rss>
