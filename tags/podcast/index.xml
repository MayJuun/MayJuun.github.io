We created an informatics podcast recently, available here. From the time we recorded the original podcast to the time we had all steps/automation established, we unfortunately found ourselves in a position of needing to rebrand.
Looking back, this proved most beneficial, as it forced me to reflect on the steps I previously took to create a podcast that harnesses GitHub and Hugo for its RSS feeds.</description></item></channel></rss>
