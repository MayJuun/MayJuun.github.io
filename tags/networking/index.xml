MayJuun is partnering with Open City Labs to demonstrate the entire closed-loop referral process, from person identification and screening assessment to creating and managing referrals.
We have also partnered with the Interoperability Institute to connect our questionnaire assessments application (Cuestionario) to their MELD open-source sandbox.

Building apps like these are well within our wheelhouse at MayJuun, and this step seemed like a nice upgrade from the basic business card.
Credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, this app builds heavily upon the open-source (MIT License) QR Code generator library called Project Nayuki. I&amp;rsquo;ve used their code-generator in a number of projects and recommend them highly.</description></item></channel></rss>
