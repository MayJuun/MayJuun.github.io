Building apps like these are well within our wheelhouse at MayJuun, and this step seemed like a nice upgrade from the basic business card.
Credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, this app builds heavily upon the open-source (MIT License) QR Code generator library called Project Nayuki. I&amp;rsquo;ve used their code-generator in a number of projects and recommend them highly.</description></item><item><title>A Meta-Post for a Meta-Blog</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/1-meta-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 13:15:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/1-meta-post/</guid><description>Welcome to the Informatics Meta-Blog - Knowledge is power&amp;hellip;and best shared with others. This is the place where any informatician, innovator, or entrepreneur can crowd-source contribute and build upon each others&amp;rsquo; knowledge.
Many of the things I post here will be open-source and moderately technical, but that&amp;rsquo;s only my preference. If there&amp;rsquo;s something else you want to share about healthcare, informatics, innovation, or entrepreneurship, please feel free. Try to add/share some knowledge if you can&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t just post something that&amp;rsquo;s a shameless plug for your work.</description></item></channel></rss>
