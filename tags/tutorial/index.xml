Note that page# is an integer that starts at 1, not 0.
I needed this in a project where the Flutter packages that performed PDF search functions were not performant, had memory leaks, or seemed to work inconsistently across platforms.</description></item><item><title>Get Fluttered: MVC+S Architecture, Example</title><link>https://mayjuun.com/blog/2-get-fluttered-mvcs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 19:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayjuun.com/blog/2-get-fluttered-mvcs/</guid><description>Intro - To all who watched my original GetFluttered: MVC+S Architecture video, I want to thank you immensely for your patience.
Before making new GetFluttered videos, we wanted to implement:
A means to provide written, supplemental info &amp;hellip; Meta-Blog; A complex, production-level MVC+S example &amp;hellip; PRAPARE app; &amp;amp; A means for others to join / collaborate &amp;hellip; FlutterJuun Slack invite. With these elements now firmly established, it should be easier to follow along with GetFluttered content by comparing simple + complex code examples that achieve the same objective.</description></item></channel></rss>
