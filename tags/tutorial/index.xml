      <description>Intro - Well, I can&amp;rsquo;t say this issue will come up too often for others&amp;hellip;but should you ever need it, here are the exact steps you can take to convert all the text from a PDF file into a JSON file with key-value pairs of &amp;quot;page#&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;all page text without extra white space&amp;quot;. Note that page# is an integer that starts at 1, not 0.
I needed this in a project where the Flutter packages that performed PDF search functions were not performant, had memory leaks, or seemed to work inconsistently across platforms.</description>

      <description>Intro - To all who watched my original GetFluttered: MVC+S Architecture video, I want to thank you immensely for your patience.
Before making new GetFluttered videos, we wanted to implement:
 A means to provide written, supplemental info &amp;hellip; Meta-Blog; A complex, production-level MVC+S example &amp;hellip; PRAPARE app; &amp;amp; A means for others to join / collaborate &amp;hellip; FlutterJuun Slack invite.  With these elements now firmly established, it should be easier to follow along with GetFluttered content by comparing simple + complex code examples that achieve the same objective.</description>
